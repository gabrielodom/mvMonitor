\title{Process Data under a System Signal Amplification}
\format{
An xts data matrix with 10080 rows and four columns, corresponding to
  one week worth of data recorded at a 1-minute interval. The columns under
  normal conditions are defined in the help file for normal_switch_xts. The
  fault is a signal amplification in the underlying determining t vector. The
  fault starts at row 8500, and the four columns under the fault state are
  defined here:
\describe{
  \item{state : }{the state indicator for the multivariate system, with three
  levels}
  \item{x : }{x(t_*) = t_* + error}
  \item{y : }{y(t_*) = (t_*) ^ 2 - 3t + error}
  \item{z : }{z(t_*) = - (t_*) ^ 3 + 3(t_*) ^ 2 + error}
}
where t_* = 3 * t * (10080 - s) / (2 * 10080), where s is the observation
index, and t is a 10080-entry vector of autocorrelated and non-stationary
hidden process realizations. The states alternate each hour and are defined
as follows:
\describe{
  \item{State1 -- }{As presented}
  \item{State2 -- }{Rotated by (yaw = 0, pitch = 90, roll = 30) and scaled by
  (1 * x, 0.5 * y , 2 * z).}
  \item{State3 -- }{Rotated by (yaw = 90, pitch = 0, roll = -30) and scaled by
  (0.25 * x, 0.1 * y , 0.75 * z).}
}
