Description: Use multi-state splitting to apply Adaptive-Dynamic PCA (ADPCA) to
    data generated from a continuous-time multivariate industrial or natural
    process. Employ PCA-based dimension reduction to extract linear combinations
    of relevant features, reducing computational burdens. For a description of 
    ADPCA, see <doi:10.1007/s00477-016-1246-2>, the 2016 paper from Kazor et al.
    The multi-state application of ADPCA is from a manuscript under current
    revision entitled "Multi-State Multivariate Statistical Process Control" by
    Odom, Newhart, Cath, and Hering, and is  expected to appear in Q1 of 2018.
